\section sec_codeblocks Build libdspl-2.0 by CodeBlocks IDE

You must first install all the necessary utilities.
If this step is not done, see section:
\n
\ref getting_started_toolchain
\n





\subsection sec_codeblocks_download Download libdspl-2.0 source code
Download libdspl-2.0 source code from
<a href="https://github.com/Dsplib/libdspl-2.0">
Github.com:
</a>
\n

\n
You can clone project by Git or just download zip-archive.

Unzip or clone project to the folder.

You can unzip to any directory, here `libdspl-2.0` will be
indicate the directory in which the source codes are unzipped.

As an example, the source codes were unzipped to
directory `J:\libdspl-2.0`.







\subsection sec_codeblocks_start Run CodeBlocks IDE and settings
Run CodeBlocks IDE and select menu`File -> Open`: 
\n
\n

\n
\n
Open `\libdspl-2.0\ide\codeblocks`,
here `libdspl-2.0` - directory into which the project was unzipped or cloned.
\n
\n

\n
\n
Open `dspl.workspace` and select 
`examples -> src -> dspl_info_test.c`.
Test program source code we can see in editor. 
Test program links `libdspl.dll` and run `dspl_info` function.

Before the first build of projects: you need to configure
CodeBlocks environment for working with the GCC compiler and debugger. \n 
Open menu `Settings->Compiler`:
\n
\n

Press `OK` and CodeBlocks is ready to working. 




\subsection sec_codeblocks_compile Build librray and run test program
Run menu `Build -> Rebuild workspace`:

\n
If the dialogue with the question is opened, then we press `Yes`:

\n
\n
As a result, the first compilation of the project will begin, which may take
few minutes because you need to compile for the first time
BLAS and LAPACK libraries. Subsequent builds will be faster
because only modified files will need to be recompiled.

Upon completion of the compilation, a message will appear 
in the `Build log` field as in the picture:
\n
\n

\n
The project is ready and we just have to run the application:
\n
\n
\image html codeblocks_11.png
\n
\n
As a result, a console window will appear in which the function `dspl_info`
will display information about the libdspl library:

CodeBlocks configuration and project compilation completed successfully.
