\section sec_getting_started_make Build libdspl-2.0 by make program

You must first install all the necessary utilities.
If this step is not done, see section: \n 
\ref getting_started_toolchain
\n


\subsection sec_make_download Download libdspl-2.0 source code

Download libdspl-2.0 source code from
<a href="https://github.com/Dsplib/libdspl-2.0">
Github.com:
</a>

You can clone project by Git or just download zip-archive.

Unzip or clone project to the folder.

You can unzip to any directory, here `libdspl-2.0` will be
indicate the directory in which the source codes are unzipped.

As an example, the source codes were unzipped to
directory `J:\libdspl-2.0`.





\subsection sec_make_compile Build libdspl-2.0 and run test program
Open the `libdspl-2.0` directory:
\n

\n
Select address line and type `cmd`:

\n
\n
Press`[Enter]` and library compilation will begin. 
\note 
First build time depends on computer performance and may
take a few minutes. Subsequent builds will be significantly
faster because the BLA and LAPACK libraries are compiled during the
 first build and are later linked from ready-made object files. \n


After building the project, you can go to the `bin` directory in which keeps
program examples. Also in this directory you can find a ready-made library
`libdspl.dll`:

`libdspl.dll` building completes  \n
