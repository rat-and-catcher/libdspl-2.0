Building libdspl-2.0 on a Windows system requires installation 
of a compiler, Unix utilities, and Gnuplot package. 
It is also advisable to install the console file manager Far 
and IDE for developing and debugging programs. \n

DSPLIB toolchain is complete set of utilities necessary 
for working with libdspl-2.0 on a Windows system.

\n
\n
Default path is `C:\dsplib`.

\note
It is highly recommended that all components be installed in a directory.
`C:\dsplib` because IDE CodeBlocks and other programs are configured to
work from this directory.

Press `[Install]` button and the process will copy packages to
specified directory.
\n
\n

\n
Upon completion of file copying, the specified paths will be written 
in the `PATH` variable, and the FarManager and IDE CodeBlocks icons will 
be created on the desktop. \n
To complete the installation, click `[Close]`.
\n
